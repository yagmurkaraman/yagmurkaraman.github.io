<font face="Times New Roman" color="#339999" >Alan Turing was born in Londra, in June 23,1912. He trained in mathematics and cryptology. He is considered the founder of computer science. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#336699" > <h3> Scientific Work </h3> </font>
<font face="Times New Roman" color="#339999" > <p> During the Second World War, Turing was proclaimed ‘war hero’ to play an important role in breaking the German code. Turing has designed a machine called the ‘Bombe’ against machine called the ‘Enigma’.Thus, England won against Germany. Bombe took the title of World’s first computer. 
   After the war, Turing who studies computer and artificial intelligence logic, to prepare the program that has been a pioneer in this area. Accordingly, he developed the ‘Turing test’. The purpose of the Turing test is whether it is possible to say that logically think of a machine.
   When he was working at the University of Manchester, has laid the foundations of modern computer with definition of algorithm called Turing machines. In 1949, he was the deputy director in computer laboratory at the Manchester University and worked on the Manchester Mark 1 software for one of the first real computers. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#336699" > <h3> Death and After </h3> </font>
<font face="Times New Roman" color="#339999" > Turing was found dead at his home in June 8, 1954. Since 1966, technical articles are awarded by a person by ‘Association of Computer Mechanisms’. This award is the name of the ‘Turing Award’ and the Nobel Prize of Computer Science. </font>
